RC programs without source code for the FlySky CT6-A series of transmitters. These are cheap, programmable 6 channel Chinese radios which can be used in a variety of applications.

T6Config is the application that you'll want (after plugging in your radio via USB and installing the relevant driver.)

This is just a fork of the original repo which contains some working settings you can use if your original ones get messed up (the T6config software is not the most user friendly.)
